Air transport or aviation plays a very important role in the present transport structure of the world and surely it is considered the gift of the twentieth century to the world. In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, air transport has been a blessing to all because of its speed of transportation. This mode of transport is very useful to get the products with short delivery times quickly and safely to those who require it also allows the tourism industry in each country to have stable growth by shortening the distance among all the people who inhabit the world. Here, I have a dataset regarding the ratings of services provided by different airlines to customers. The main objective of this project is to understand how likely the passengers will recommend the airlines to others. The dataset here is quite large which initially had 131895 rows and 17 columns. On checking the data information, it was derived that there were basically two different types of data in the dataset there are 7 columns of floats64, data types 10 columns with object types. Coming to the null values and missing values in the dataset, it was observed that there was a mismatch in the non-null counts which clearly stated that a large number of missing and null values were present in the dataset.

Data is scrapped in the Spring of 2019 from the Skytrax website. Data includes airline reviews from 2006 to 2019 for popular airlines around the world with multiple-choice and free-text questions. The main objective is to predict whether passengers will refer the airline to them or not.
